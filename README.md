## How It Works

The script works by detecting every key pressed by the user and logging it to a file. The log file is specified in the script, and it is created automatically if it does not exist. The script logs the key presses every `count` times, where `count` is a variable that can be changed to log the key presses more or less frequently.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Install the `pynput` plugin by running `pip install pynput` in the command prompt or terminal.
2. Run the `Simple_Keylogger.py` script.
3. The script will start running and logging every key press to a file called `log.txt`.
4. To stop the script, press the `esc` key.
