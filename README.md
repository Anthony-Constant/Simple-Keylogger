<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The script works by detecting every key pressed by the user and logging it to a file. The log file is specified in the script, and it is created automatically if it does not exist. The script logs the key presses every count times, where count is a variable that can be changed to log the key presses more or less frequently.</p>
